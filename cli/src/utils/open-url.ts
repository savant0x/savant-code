/**
 * Safely open a URL in the user's default browser.
 *
 * On headless Linux (no DISPLAY or WAYLAND_DISPLAY), calling `open()` spawns
 * `xdg-open` which can crash the entire process — even inside a try/catch —
 * because the child process may trigger fatal signals. This wrapper detects
 * headless environments and skips the call entirely. WSL is exempt: there
 * `open()` goes through powershell.exe, which needs no display.
 *
 * On WSL, `open()` spawns powershell.exe from the Windows mount. If Windows
 * interop is disabled (no access to /mnt/c), that spawn fails with ENOENT.
 * Under Bun the failure is delivered before the `open()` promise resolves and
 * cannot be caught from here — not by try/catch, and not by an 'error'
 * listener attached afterward — so the only reliable defense is checking that
 * powershell.exe exists before calling `open()`. `wsl-utils` is what `open`
 * itself uses to build the path, so the check matches its behavior exactly.
 *
 * @returns `true` if the browser was (likely) opened, `false` if skipped.
