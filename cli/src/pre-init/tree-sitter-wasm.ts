// Final approach after several attempts to embed the wasm into the bun
// --compile binary all failed on Windows (the bytes ended up in the
// binary, but every JS-level retrieval mechanism — `with { type: 'file' }`
// import binding, base64 string literals, chunked base64 in a generated
// module, function-export wrappers — was either tree-shaken, transformed
// by the minifier, or otherwise stripped):
//
//   ship tree-sitter.wasm as a sibling file next to the binary.
//
// It's 200KB, the npm tarball already contains the binary; adding one
// more file is trivial. The build script copies the wasm into `cli/bin/`
// after compile, the release workflow tarballs both, and the freebuff /
// codebuff downloader extracts both into the same directory. At runtime,
// `process.execPath` plus a relative file lookup gets us the wasm with
// zero bundler involvement.

// the .exe the user invoked. By the time main() runs it switches to
// the disk path, but pre-init has long since bailed out.
//
// Try several sources in order; the first whose sibling .wasm exists
