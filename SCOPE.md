# SCOPE — Open Work Register

This register contains active work and its machine-readable write targets.
Remove completed items and grants at closure. Evidence belongs in archived
FIDs, the changelog and session summaries. Historical register/disposition
records are preserved in `dev/tracking/scope-history-2026-10-18.md`; that
snapshot grants no current write authority.

Automation levels follow `dev/echo-v0.1.2-single-agent.md` and the session
ceiling in `protocol.config.yaml`. They do not override credential handling,
verification, releases or repository boundaries.

## Open items

### EMBED-001 — superseded external single-agent embed (blocked)

- [ ] Authority: automation level 3. Updating the external target is reserved
  to the operator: `C:\Users\spenc\.config\opencode\agent\echo.md` lies outside
  the project directory. No automation level lifts that boundary.

The 409-line embed, last written 2026-08-11 when inspected, predates the
canonical `dev/echo-v0.1.2-single-agent.md`. The earlier audit found missing
scripted-edit and scope-disposition rules, the active scope register contract,
autonomy levels, step accounting, progress-push/archive rulings and current FID
statuses. It also found contradictory attribution and bootstrap instructions.
Exact evidence and the operator-only replacement procedure are retained in
the history snapshot. No external write or fresh external repair is claimed.
This session uses the canonical repository protocol.

### Release-0.0.36 — development line (publication operator-gated)

- [ ] Version 0.0.36 is an unpublished development line. Preserve the existing
  release authority; version cuts, tags, publishing and deployment still
  require explicit operator approval. Normal verified main pushes proceed
  through mandatory gates. No publication is authorized by this audit.

### HOME-SKILLS-001 — external skill diagnostics (blocked)

- [ ] `skills:check` reports 22 home-skill warnings and zero repository errors.
  Third-party frontmatter, size and command-policy diagnostics occur outside
  this project. Changing those installed skills requires an operator decision
  on the external targets; this repository audit does not grant that authority.
  Details are preserved in the hygiene audit report; no external fix is claimed.
